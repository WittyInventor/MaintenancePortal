# MaintenancePortal

## Description
```
Aptly is a maintenance portal that allows the tenant to submit a maintenance request to alert the property management company that there is an issue within the unit. It also allows the property management team to log in and view work orders, assign work orders to maintenance staff, update urgency of request, update status of work orders, and send email notifications to tenants as work is completed.
